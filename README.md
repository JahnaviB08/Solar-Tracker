# Automated Solar Tracker

Introduction

This an Arduino-based project that aims to increase the power generation of a solar panel by ensuring it constantly faces the Sun. This project uses light-dependent resistors (LDRs) to detect sunlight and a servo motor to adjust the orientation of the solar panel accordingly. As the Sun moves, the solar panel tracks its position to maximize the amount of light falling on it.

Hardware Components Needed
1. Arduino Uno
2. Servo motor
3. Two Light-Dependent Resistors (LDRs)
4. Resistor for LDR voltage divider (typically 10kÎ©).
5. Solar panel mount or frame
6. Breadboard and jumper wires
7. Power supply for Arduino (connect it to a laptop/PC).

Software Requirements

You will need the Arduino IDE to upload the code to your Arduino board.

You can refer the circuit diagram to make connections.
